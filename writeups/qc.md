# Quantum Computing and Machine Learning, and its relevance to CERN

CERN has been long held as a trendsetter for the modern landscape of particle and quantum phyiscs, with the discovery of the Higgs Boson hailed as a universal and revolutionary achievement on the level of Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment. In short, it's a big deal.

But as we move into a phase of rampant progress in the fields of Computer Science and especially AI, CERN too has adapted to the changing scientific landscape, bringing in computer scientists from around the globe.

In a previous article from Mario ("Computing at CERN"), he briefly discussed the various applications of AI and Machine Learning at CERN, and with simulatory tools allowing us to explore that in great detail, we have been able to explore more than was possible.

In recent years, both Quantum Computing and Machine Learning has seen revolutionary progress, from the slow but intense investment in Quantum Computing hardware and the _qubit_, to Machine Learning's use in pretty much every industry nowadays.

But how does CERN use these technologies to aid in their work?
