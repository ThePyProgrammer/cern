CERN has been long held as a trendsetter for the modern landscape of particle and quantum phyiscs, with the discovery of the Higgs Boson hailed as a universal and revolutionary achievement on the level of Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment. In short, it's a big deal.

But as we move into a phase of rampant progress in the fields of Computer Science and especially AI, CERN too has adapted to the changing scientific landscape, bringing in computer scientists from around the globe.

In a previous article from Mario ("Computing at CERN"), he discussed the various applications of AI and Machine Learning at CERN, and with simulatory tools allowing us to explore that in great detail, we have been able to explore more than was possible.

## Image Reconstruction and Tomography

A popular application of computer science, and particularly in the field of AI, is computed tomography. _Tomography_ is defined as the
