# Fundamental Physics with Accelerators
> by <i>Albert De Roeck</i>

Physics, and Science as a whole, is largely predicated on answering major philosophical questions, which are considered **fundamental questions**. These questions are majorly supposed to clarify the extent of our understanding of the universe, such as the following:
- What is the world made of?
- What holds the world together?
- Where did we come from?

These questions follow the following Venn Diagram:

Physics divides itself into major factions to answer these questions. Astrophysicists aim to answer questions related, in large part, to the **Cosmic Frontier**, trying to understand the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, the origin and evolution of the universe, and more.

On the other hand, particle physicists aim to explore the **Energy Frontier** and the **Intensity Frontier**, with a large of focus on the origin of mass in the universe. With a major focus on the basis of fundamental particles, we have developed technologies to explore said elementary particles, leading to the invention of particle accelerators. These accelerators aim to explore the basic make-up of such particles, and this is explored in 2 major experiments, **fixed-target** and **collider** experiments.


### Fixed Target Experiments
Fixed Target Experiments involve running a beam of particles at a fixed target (e.g. a wall). A major example of such experiments is Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment, which sought to discover the structure of the atom. However, notably, we've seen that energy is not conserved in such experiements, and the following expression largely dictates the relationship between the beam and the final energy of the system.

$$E = \sqrt{E_\text{beam}}$$

### Collider Experiments
A more novel experimental procedure which largely came to interest in the mid-1970s is that of colliding two beams in a circular/linear structure. This allows the two beams to collide elastically and hence the final energy of the system is conserved!

$$E = E_\text{beam1}+E_\text{beam2}$$
The LHC, for instance, currently follows this.
