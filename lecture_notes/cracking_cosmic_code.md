Some cool stuff:

If you drop liquid nitrogen onto a warmer floor, the droplets bounce. This is because of the _Leidenfrost effect_ (kinda, I'm bad at physics) wherein the colder liquid nitrogen has a layer of gaseous nitrogen below it, which causes it to levitate.

CERN uses Liquid Helium in the LHC, and Helium on its own has no triple point, thus you cannot get Solid Helium unless you apply excessive pressure (20 atm at 1 K). This Liquid Helium is known as a superfluid.
